# Kernel
It enables any other programs to execute. It handles events generated by hardware (called interrupts) and software (called system calls), and manages access to resources.

The kernel usually defines a few abstractions like files, processes, sockets, directories, etc. which correspond to an internal state it remembers about last operations, so that a program may issue a session of operation more efficiently.
